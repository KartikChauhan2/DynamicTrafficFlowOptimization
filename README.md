Dynamic Traffic Flow Optimization is a desktop-based project designed to simulate and analyze vehicle movement across a traffic network. 
It uses a visual, map-based interface to optimize and display real-time traffic flow by taking into account source, destination, vehicle type, and priority. 
The application allows users to add vehicles, compute shortest paths using graph algorithms, and visualize traffic movement dynamically.
The project is built using C and GTK for the GUI, with a modular approach involving key components like the Priority Module, Information Module, Interface Module, Graph Module, and Main Module. 
It aims to assist in understanding and experimenting with traffic optimization concepts, offering a practical solution that reflects real-world traffic scenarios.
This project is ideal for academic demonstration, smart city planning prototypes, or educational use to illustrate how data structures, algorithms, and user interface elements can be combined to solve complex system problems like urban traffic management.
